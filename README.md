  ## Installation
  To install this application, please download the source code from github at https://github.com/danster4/c-10-team-profile-generator and install node and inquirer onto your IDE of choice.

  ## Usage
  To use this application, please open your IDE and in the command line, type 'node index' to run the application. There, you will be prompted to answer a few questions and the HTML file will populate in the dist folder, as well as a corresponding CSS file.

  ## Credits
  I want to thank the Fall 2021 UCF Coding Bootcamp staff for their continued help and support in matters related and not related to web development.
  
  ## License
  There is currently no license for this application at this time.

  ## Features
  The main feature of this application is using the power of JavaScript and Node.js to dynamically create a HTML file without the user writing a line of HTML in an actual HTML file. The command line prompts will fill in the answers to create the file for the user automatically.
